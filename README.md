# Switchbacks

## Requirements

- This project uses the latest node version `v16.13.2`. Check your system by running `node --version` and if you are out of date, use `nvm` to switch between versions. Read more on how to install `nvm` [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

- To keep in sync with code formatting (format on Save, etc.) and linter errors, this project uses VS Code. Stop right there, I don't care about your crappy text editor. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Install

```
yarn
yarn dev
```
